**InfoData API Repo**

This is a repo created for the purpose of
converting the foreclosures.csv file to json 
and hosting converted data on GitHub.

The steps I took were:
❀ Created an infoData directory and initialized the node.js project.
❀ Installed a dependency called csvtojson
❀ Created .nojekyll file to avoid unnecessary jekyll processing.
❀ Loaded in csv data and created an app.js file to write the code necessary for file conversion
❀ Reviewed foreclosures.json and uploaded to github for hosting.
